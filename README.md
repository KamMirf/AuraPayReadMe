This project aims to demonstrate the viability of using existing bluetooth frameworks (and Apple's CoreBluetooth sample code) for the purposes of digital payments. Apple Pay was used because of its ease of integration. CoreBluetooth was chosen over some newer features of iPhones and IOS versions (e.g. multi-peer connectivity) because of its backwards compatibility and because it would make interacting with Android devices much easier. With that said, the next goal for this project is to take advantage of the newer features to create a more involved user experience. Specifically, I am planning on experimenting with multi-peer connectivity and Apple's artificial reality framework (ARKit) to allow for paying/receiving money dissimilar to many payment services available today.
